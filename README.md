 # SHARC

Welcome to the official web page of SHARC, simulator for use in SHARing and Compatibility studies of radiocommunication systems. The development of this software is being lead by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) of Brazil, ANATEL, and it implements the framework proposed by Recommendation ITU-R M.2101 for "modelling and simulation of IMT networks and systems for use in sharing and compatibility studies".

The first official release of the simulator is not ready yet (this is the reason for the master branch being empty), but you can take a look at the development branch for the most recent working version. User's Guide and Developper's Guide will be available soon. In the meantime, please go to the Wiki page for instructions on how to configure the development environment, how to run simulations and how to obtain Windows compatible executable files.

If you have any question about this simulator, please contact Edgar Souza (edgar@anatel.gov.br).
