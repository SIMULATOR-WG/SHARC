This file at the root directory should give general information to both users 
and maintainers of a project. It should be raw text or written in some very 
easy to read markup, such as reStructuredText or Markdown. It should contain a 
few lines explaining the purpose of the project or library (without assuming 
the user knows anything about the project), the URL of the main source for the 
software, and some basic credit information. This file is the main entry point 
for readers of the code.


TODO

This section should list the planned development for the code




CHANGELOG
